# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in improving Mechanoid.

We would like your help to make this project better, so we appreciate any contributions.

## How to use our Github repository

The `main` branch of this repo will always have the latest released version of Mechanoid. All of the active development work for the next release will take place in the `dev` branch. Mechanoid will use semantic versioning and will create a tag/release for each release.

Here is how to contribute back some code or documentation:

- Fork repo
- Create a feature branch off of the `dev` branch
- Make some useful change
- Submit a pull request against the `dev` branch.
- Be kind
